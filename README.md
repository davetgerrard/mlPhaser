Prototype code for mlPhaser: R code to extract likely haplotypes from genotypes with ploidy > 1.  Not very mathematical but designed around highly diverse loci (HLA) where each haplotypes is relatively rare.

Will require external information with haplotype definitions and frequencies.

Some code here is to integrate with genotype calls from mlgt runs.

Work in progress.
